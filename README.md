## Data description and preprocessing

### **Cardiac CCTA Data** (Our private dataset)

- Due to privacy issues, the training data cannot be made public at present, but we supplemented the description and the annotation details of the data to facilitate readers to have an objective understanding of our private data set.
- **「Source and acquisition protocols」** **Cardiac CCTA Data** is multi-center and multi-device data. CCTA images from 132 patients whose stenoses were found in the major epicardial coronary arteries by CTA were selected. Two hospitals in China (Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People’s Hospital, Shanghai and Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing) provided the imaging data. For the data from the first hospital, a 128-slice multidetector CT (Definition AS, Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) was employed for scanning.
