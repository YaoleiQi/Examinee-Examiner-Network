# Examinee-Examiner Network: Weakly Supervised Accurate Coronary Lumen Segmentation using Centerline Constraint

The implementation of Examinee-Examiner Network: Weakly Supervised Accurate Coronary Lumen Segmentation using Centerline Constraint.

## Environment and parameters illustration

- This repository is based  on Python 3.7.1, PyTorch 1.6 and numpy 1.16.5.

- Our EE-Net was optimized by Adam with the learning rate of $1 \times 10 ^ {-4}$. The training batch size was 1 and the networks were all trained iteratively with 400 epochs.
