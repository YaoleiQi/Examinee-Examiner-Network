# Examinee-Examiner Network: Weakly Supervised Accurate Coronary Lumen Segmentation using Centerline Constraint

The implementation of Examinee-Examiner Network: Weakly Supervised Accurate Coronary Lumen Segmentation using Centerline Constraint.

## Environment

- This repository is based  on Python 3.7.1, PyTorch 1.6 and numpy 1.16.5.
- Other networks and Our EE-Net were all optimized by Adam with the learning rate of $1\times10^{-4}$. The training batch size was 1 and the networks were all trained iteratively with 400 epochs.
